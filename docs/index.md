# Welcome

Hi there! I'm Jake. Below you can find some things I've decided to blab off about.

I mainly write about programming and security, but I may write about other things as well when I feel like it.

No way you people are actually reading this, right?


```py
def main():
    print("Hello, World!")
    print("Welcome to my blog!")
    print("I hope you find something interesting here.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
